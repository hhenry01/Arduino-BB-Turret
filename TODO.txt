- Update images and circuit/PCB to reflect changes in code

- Circuit still requires the Arduino's USB to be plugged in for some reason.

- Fire rate too fast
BB can't fall down and sit properly in chamber before launcher released. Suboptimal impact results in drastic velocity decrease. 
Single shots with careful manual presses have much more velocity and distance.

Potential solution: When a button press is detected, run the motor for a certain amount of time (enough to pull it back all the way), 
then pause to let the BB drop into place. After the delay, release. Need to restrict aiming downwards.

- Double feed issue with funnel loader
The BB above the current one in the chamber will press against the lower one, pushing it out of its optimal position (especially if operating slower). 
Additionally, by pushing it out of the way it makes space for itself, resulting in a double feed and drastically reduced velocity.

Potential solutions:
Complex - Mechanically operate a blocker to prevent the next BB coming in.
Complex - Use a spring operated loading system and control loading that way. Needs a lot more components.
Simpler - Keep the chambered BB in a set position with blockers that will only let the angled tip of the launcher through.
Can do this with portrusions on the interior of the chamber, but will need to shorten (or sharpen the angle of) the launcher.
Also requires slight tilt back or no tilt.
